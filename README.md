Predicting heart disease using machine learning is a common task in healthcare analytics. 

Steps to build a heart disease prediction model:
Database : heart_data.csv

Data Preprocessing: Prepared and cleaned the data. This includes handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).

Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the data's distribution and relationships. Visualization techniques helped understand the data better.

Feature Selection/Engineering: Select relevant features that could improve the model's performance. 

Split the Data: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

Chosen a suitable machine learning algorithm for classification. Some of the choices are : 
1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
7. XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
8. Artificial Neural Network(Keras)

Model Training: Trained the chosen model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
